# Progetto_cmepda
This repository belongs to Laura Toni and Maria Irene Tenerani.
It contains our project exam for the course of Computing Methods for Experimental Physics and Data Analysis.
The aim of our project is to implement a convolutional neural network to classify grey matter image segments obtained from the brain MRIs of a cohort of subjects with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and control.
Applying transfer learning we also used the pre-trained CNN layers to predict the age and the mini mental test score of the patients.
