Convolutional neural network for Alzheimer and control
======================================================

This is the documetation of our exam project for the course of Computing Methods for Experimental Physics and Data Analysis.
We implemented a convolutional neural network to classify grey matter image segments obtained from the brain MRIs of a cohort of subjects with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and control.
Applying transfer learning we also used the pre-trained CNN layers to predict the age and the mini mental test score of the patients.
